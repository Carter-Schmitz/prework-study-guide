# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## A site to store study information for the bootcamp

To enhance my learning experience throughout the bootcamp and keep a repository of notes, I created this site. Organizing all of this information in one place as an interactive media will help me retain this information. Building this site has provided me with a rudimentary grasp of the fundamentals of web development.

## Installation

No installation required.

## Usage

Site is simple in format and easy to use. Simply view the main page to see all notes.
